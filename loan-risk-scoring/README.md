# AI-Enhanced Loan Risk Scoring

## Business Problem
Traditional credit scores often miss good borrowers or approve risky ones because they ignore alternative payment behavior.

## Solution
Deploy **Azure Machine Learning classification model** that combines credit bureau data with alternative data (utility bills, rent payments, income stability).

## Dataset
Synthetic or anonymized banking loan application dataset.

## Technical Stack
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), SQL
- **AI Platform:** Azure Machine Learning
- **Integration:** APIs to pull data from credit bureaus
- **Visualization:** Power BI risk dashboard

## Process
1. Combine structured and alternative credit data.
2. Clean and preprocess data with Python.
3. Train classification model for risk prediction.
4. Deploy scoring API integrated into loan origination systems.

## Results
- Expanded approvals for underserved but creditworthy customers.
- Reduced manual underwriting time by 50%.
- Improved portfolio performance.
